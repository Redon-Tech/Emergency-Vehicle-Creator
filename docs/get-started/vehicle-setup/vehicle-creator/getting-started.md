2. Open Roblox Studio.
3. Install the plugin by going to "Toolbox" > "My Plugins" and selecting the Emergency Vehicle Creator plugin from your list of installed plugins.
      1. If you don't see it, you may need to refresh the Toolbox or restart Roblox Studio.
4. Launch the plugin by clicking on its icon in the Plugins tab.
      1. If the button doesn't appear, you may need to restart Roblox Studio or check if the plugin is enabled in the "Manage Plugins" section.
      2. If the old version is launched, please ensure you are updated!
